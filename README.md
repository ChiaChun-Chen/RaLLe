# RᴀLLᴇ

RᴀLLᴇ is an accessible framework for developing and evaluating retrieval-augmented large language models (R-LLMs).  
An overview of the main uses of RᴀLLᴇ on GUI is presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShMNYSBJNnc).


It is developed at [the Institute of Memory Technology Research and Development](https://www.kioxia.com/en-jp/rd/organization/memory-technology-rd.html) of [Kioxia Corporation](https://www.kioxia.com/en-jp/top.html).

## Key Features

- *Easy development and testing*: users can easily select, combine, and test various retrievers and LLMs, including open-source models, within a graphical interface.
- *Objective evaluation of R-LLMs*: RᴀLLᴇ provides reproducible experiments with objective benchmarks/metrics, enabling objective assessments of R-LLM performance.
- *Transparent prompt engineering*: all input (prompts) and output of an LLM are visible to the user, allowing for easy exploration and optimization of prompts.
